## Overview

This is my first attempt at using Frontend Mentor and very new to coding with HTML and CSS.

This attempt is very simple, with basic HTML & CSS. An attempt has been made to be semantically correct and to organize the CSS with minimal but pertinent commenting.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

#### Display

Inline-block conforms the container to the size of the contents by default.

#### Border Radius

Nested elements need to have proportionally smaller border radii.

#### Media Queries

I found it repetitive to create media queries for various different screen sizes. There must be a way to reduce the number of media queries while also making the page consistently proportionate looking as the screen size decreases.

On the plus side I found a list of some [common breakpoints](###useful-resources) that I might be able to use in future templates.

#### Resetting Margin and Padding

It is important to always reset margin and padding to 0px with a * selector at the top of the CSS stylesheet so that there isn't any unintentional margins and padding.

#### GitHub

- Setting up a repository
- Committing to a repository from my local computer using GitHub Desktop
- Using GitHub Pages to make the solution visible as web page publically

### Continued development

- learn mobile first development with media queries that use "min-width" and apply to future development
- understaning flexbox more concretely so I am certain how best to center any given element
- what are the ways to conform the size of the parent element to the size of the children and which to use under which circumstances

### Useful resources
